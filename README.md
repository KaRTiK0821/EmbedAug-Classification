# Infant Cry Classification with CNN & EmbedAug

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project classifies infant cries into categories like **asphyxia, deaf, hunger, normal, and pain** using a CNN-based architecture enhanced with **EmbedAug** and **audio waveform-level augmentation**. It leverages **Mel-spectrogram features**, **weighted loss**, and **early stopping** for improved performance. Achieved ~81% accuracy on the Baby Chillanto dataset.

## âœ… Features
- CNN-based classifier for audio classification  
- **EmbedAug** (feature-level augmentation)  
- **Waveform-level augmentations** (noise, time-shift, volume scaling)  
- **Class-weighted loss** to handle imbalance  
- **Early stopping & best model saving**  
- **Evaluation metrics**: Confusion Matrix, F1-score, CSV export

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
Dataset should be structured as:
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ asphyxia/
â”œâ”€â”€ deaf/
â”œâ”€â”€ hunger/
â”œâ”€â”€ normal/
â””â”€â”€ pain/

---

Each folder contains `.wav` files for its respective class.
